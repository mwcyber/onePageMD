# Open Cyber Index

## Introduction

Simple collection of useful sites and web apps divided by categories.
The main categories collected are Cybersecurity and general IT.

## What is it

The basic project is a frontend that renders a series of md files in which the favorite sites are collected.

The main technologies used are:
- Svelte
- Bootstrap
- Marked library

## How it works

All md files are saved in the '/asset/pages/' folder and the main page loads them dynamically.

The javascript code of the main page provides in a variable a small list in which the points to the files to be shown are collected.

The md files added to the list are rendered automatically.

To create a new page in the list just create the relevant md file and add it to the following list:

```
const files = [
    { value: "cybersecurity.md", label: "Cybersecurity" },
    { value: "network.md", label: "Network" }.
    ...
  ];
```
