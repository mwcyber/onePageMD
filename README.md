# onePageMD

## Introduction

This project is a frontend application designed to display a series of markdown (md) files on a single page, allowing users to select and view the content of their choice. Whether you're creating documentation, a personal wiki, or any content-driven application, onePageMD simplifies the process of organizing and presenting multiple markdown files.

## What is it?

This project serves as a user-friendly interface for rendering markdown files within a single web page. 

The primary technologies employed in this project include:

- **Svelte:** A modern JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- **Bootstrap:** A popular CSS framework for styling and layout.
- **Marked library:** A markdown parser and compiler for JavaScript.

## How it works

All markdown files are stored in the `/asset/pages/` folder, and the main page dynamically loads and renders them. The JavaScript code on the main page manages a small list containing references to the files to be displayed. As files are added to this list, they are automatically rendered on the page.

To add a new page to the list, simply create the corresponding markdown file and append its details to the list in the code snippet below:

```javascript
const files = [
    { value: "page01.md", label: "Page one label" },
    { value: "page02.md", label: "Page two label" },
    // Add more pages as needed
  ];
```
